## Project Structure

The project consists of three main components:

- `web/` - A React-based web application using Vite and Chakra UI
- `mobile/` - A React Native mobile application using Expo
- `server/` - An Express.js backend server with TypeScript and Prisma

## Features

- üîê WebAuthn/Passkey Authentication
- üåê Cross-platform support (Web + Mobile)
- üé® Modern UI with Chakra UI (Web) and React Native components (Mobile)
- üîÑ Consistent authentication experience across platforms
- üì± Native biometric authentication support on mobile
- üõ°Ô∏è Secure backend implementation with TypeScript

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Yarn package manager
- Expo CLI (for mobile development)
- iOS Simulator or Android Emulator (for mobile testing)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/webauthn_polished.git
cd webauthn_polished
\`\`\`

2. Install dependencies for all projects:
\`\`\`bash
yarn install
\`\`\`

## Running the Projects

You can run all projects simultaneously using:

\`\`\`bash
yarn start
\`\`\`

This will start:
- Web frontend at http://localhost:3000
- Backend server at http://localhost:3333
- Mobile app (Expo) at http://localhost:8081

### Running Projects Individually

#### Web Application
\`\`\`bash
cd web
yarn dev
\`\`\`

#### Backend Server
\`\`\`bash
cd server
yarn dev
\`\`\`

#### Mobile Application

\`\`\`

## Project Details

### Web Application (web/)
- Built with React + Vite
- Uses Chakra UI for modern, accessible components
- Features:
  - User registration with WebAuthn
  - Login with WebAuthn
  - Protected home page
  - Responsive design

### Mobile Application (mobile/)
- Built with React Native + Expo
- Uses react-native-passkey for WebAuthn support
- Features:
  - Native biometric authentication
  - User registration
  - Secure authentication flow
  - Platform-specific optimizations

### Backend Server (server/)
- Built with Express.js + TypeScript
- Uses Prisma for database management
- Features:
  - WebAuthn registration endpoints
  - Authentication verification
  - Secure session management
  - Type-safe API implementation

## API Endpoints

The backend server exposes the following endpoints:

- `POST /auth/register-options` - Get registration options
- `POST /auth/register-verify` - Verify registration
- `POST /auth/login-options` - Get authentication options
- `POST /auth/login-verify` - Verify authentication

## Security Considerations

- All WebAuthn operations follow the latest security standards
- Secure storage of credentials using platform-specific capabilities
- Implementation follows FIDO Alliance best practices
- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) properly configured
